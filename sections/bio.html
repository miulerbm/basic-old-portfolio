            I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate from Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, Peru. Currently based in Peru, I have a strong background in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). My current research focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL), where I am actively working on controlling a quadcopter using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm in MATLAB.
